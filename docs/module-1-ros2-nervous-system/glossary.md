# Glossary: ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics

## A

**Action**: A goal-oriented communication pattern in ROS 2 that provides feedback and allows for cancelation of long-running tasks.

**Agent**: A high-level decision-making component in a robotic system that determines what actions the robot should take.

## C

**Controller**: A low-level component in a robotic system that translates high-level commands into specific actuator commands.

## D

**DDS (Data Distribution Service)**: The middleware standard that ROS 2 is built on, providing the underlying communication infrastructure.

## J

**Joint**: A connection between two links in a robot that allows for relative motion between them. Types include fixed, revolute, continuous, and prismatic.

## L

**Link**: A rigid body in a robot model that has physical properties like mass, visual appearance, and collision properties.

## N

**Node**: A process that performs computation in ROS. Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a ROS system.

## O

**OOS (Open, Operate, Share)**: The philosophy that underlies the ROS ecosystem emphasizing open development, reliable operation, and knowledge sharing.

**Odom (Odometry)**: Information about a robot's change in position over time, typically provided by sensors.

## P

**Publisher**: A component that sends messages to a topic in the publish-subscribe communication pattern.

## S

**Service**: A communication pattern in ROS that provides request-response interactions between nodes.

**Subscriber**: A component that receives messages from a topic in the publish-subscribe communication pattern.

## T

**Topic**: A named bus over which nodes exchange messages in a publish-subscribe pattern.

**TF (Transform)**: A system for tracking coordinate frame relationships over time in a robotic system.

## U

**URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)**: An XML-based format for representing robot models, including links, joints, and their properties.

## R

**ROS (Robot Operating System)**: A flexible framework for writing robot software that provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, and tools.
