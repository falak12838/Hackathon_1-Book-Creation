# Introduction to ROS 2 for Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the educational module on ROS 2 for humanoid robotics! This module will guide you through the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) specifically tailored for humanoid robot applications.

## What You'll Learn

In this module, you'll explore:

- **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Understand the core concepts of ROS 2 and how they apply to humanoid robotics
- **Communication Models**: Learn about nodes, topics, and services in the context of humanoid robot control
- **Robot Structure**: Discover how to describe robot structure using URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- AI students and developers entering humanoid robotics
- Learners with basic Python and AI background
- Anyone interested in understanding how ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" for humanoid robots

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, you should have:
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Fundamental understanding of AI/ML concepts
- General knowledge of robotics concepts (kinematics, sensors, actuators)

## Getting Started
