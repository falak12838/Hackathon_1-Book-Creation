## Introduction

Gazebo is a powerful physics simulation engine that allows for realistic simulation of robots in complex environments. For humanoid robots, understanding physics simulation is crucial as it forms the foundation for all other digital twin capabilities. Students must understand how to create realistic physical interactions before adding higher-level features like sensors or Human-Robot Interaction (HRI).

In this chapter, we'll cover the fundamentals of physics simulation using Gazebo, with a focus on humanoid robot applications. We'll start with basic setup and progress to more complex simulations involving forces, collisions, and environmental interactions.

## Expected Completion Time

Students should expect to complete this chapter within 4 hours of following the tutorials.

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, students will have a solid foundation in physics simulation principles, which will be essential for the subsequent chapters on digital twins and sensor simulation.
