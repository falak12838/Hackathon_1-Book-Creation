# Chapter 2: Digital Twins & HRI using Unity

## Overview

This chapter introduces students to creating high-fidelity digital twins and Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios using Unity. Students will learn how to visualize and interact with simulated humanoid robots in realistic 3D environments, building upon the physics simulation foundation established in Chapter 1.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, students will be able to:
- Set up Unity for robotics simulation and visualization
- Create high-fidelity digital twins of humanoid robots
- Implement Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) scenarios
- Develop UI controls for robot manipulation
- Create realistic visual feedback for robot interactions

## Prerequisites

- Completion of Chapter 1 (Physics Simulation with Gazebo)
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with 3D modeling concepts (helpful but not required)

## Introduction

A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical entity that enables understanding, prediction, and optimization of its performance. In robotics, digital twins allow us to visualize robot states, test interaction scenarios, and validate behaviors in a safe, controlled environment.

Unity provides an excellent platform for creating high-fidelity digital twins due to its powerful rendering capabilities, physics engine, and extensive asset library. Combined with the physics simulation knowledge from Chapter 1, students will learn to create compelling visualization and interaction experiences.

This chapter builds upon the physics understanding from Chapter 1, connecting the simulated physical behaviors with visual representations and interactive controls.

## Expected Completion Time

Students should expect to complete this chapter within 6 hours of following the tutorials.

## Next Steps

After completing this chapter, students will have mastered the creation of high-fidelity digital twins and HRI scenarios, preparing them for Chapter 3 on sensor simulation and validation.
