# Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation with Gazebo & Unity

Welcome to Module 2 of the AI and Robotics Educational Book. This module focuses on Digital Twin Simulation using Gazebo and Unity, providing students with hands-on experience in creating simulated humanoid environments.

## Overview

This module is structured as three progressive chapters:

1. **Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo** - Learn to create realistic physics-based simulations using Gazebo
2. **Chapter 2: Digital Twins & HRI using Unity** - Create high-fidelity digital twins and Human-Robot Interaction scenarios using Unity
3. **Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation & Validation** - Simulate various sensors (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) and validate their outputs

Each chapter builds upon the previous one, providing a comprehensive learning path for understanding digital twin simulation in robotics applications.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, students will be able to:
- Create realistic physics simulations using Gazebo for humanoid robots
- Build high-fidelity digital twins in Unity with Human-Robot Interaction capabilities
- Simulate various sensors and validate their outputs against expected patterns
- Understand the integration between physics simulation, visualization, and sensor data in digital twin environments

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, students should have:
- Basic understanding of robotics concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
- Basic knowledge of ROS 2 (covered in Module 1)
