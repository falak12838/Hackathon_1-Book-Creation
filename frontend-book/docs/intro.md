# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive course on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This course will take you through the complete journey of building intelligent humanoid robots that can perceive, reason, and act in physical environments.

## Course Overview

This course is structured into four comprehensive modules that build upon each other to create sophisticated humanoid robots:

### Module 1: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System
- Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI
- ROS 2 Communication Model
- Robot Structure with URDF
- Module Checklist and Edge Cases

### Module 2: Digital Twin - Simulation & Validation
- Physics Simulation with Gazebo
- Digital Twins & Human-Robot Interaction using Unity
- Sensor Simulation & Validation
- Chapter exercises for hands-on practice

### Module 3: AI Robot Brain - Perception & Navigation
- Isaac Sim for Photorealistic Simulation
- Isaac ROS for Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (VSLAM)
- Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation
- Advanced perception and mapping techniques

### Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) - Human Interaction
- Voice-to-Action with OpenAI Whisper
- Cognitive Planning using LLMs for ROS 2
- Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid – Integration & Task Execution

## Learning Path

Each module is designed to build upon the previous one, creating a complete pipeline from basic robotics concepts to advanced AI-driven humanoid systems. You'll progress from understanding the foundational ROS 2 architecture through simulation and digital twins, to AI perception and navigation, and finally to natural human interaction through voice and cognitive planning.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this course, you should have:
- Basic understanding of Python programming
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Some exposure to robotics concepts (helpful but not required)
- Access to a computer capable of running simulation software

## Getting Started

Begin with Module 1 to establish the foundational ROS 2 concepts that will be essential throughout the entire course. Each module contains theoretical concepts, practical exercises, and hands-on projects to reinforce your learning.

Let's begin this exciting journey into the future of humanoid robotics!
