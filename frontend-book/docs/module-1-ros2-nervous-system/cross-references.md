### Nodes and Communication
- **Nodes** (introduced in [Introduction to ROS 2](./introduction-to-ros2-for-physical-ai.md)) are the fundamental units that participate in the communication patterns described in [ROS 2 Communication Model](./ros2-communication-model.md)
- **Topics, Services, Actions** (detailed in [ROS 2 Communication Model](./ros2-communication-model.md)) are the ways nodes communicate with each other

### Robot Structure and Simulation
- **URDF** (covered in [Robot Structure with URDF](./robot-structure-with-urdf.md)) defines the robot model that would be controlled by nodes implementing communication patterns from [ROS 2 Communication Model](./ros2-communication-model.md)
- **Simulation Readiness** (mentioned in [Robot Structure with URDF](./robot-structure-with-urdf.md)) requires proper implementation of communication patterns to control the simulated robot

### Humanoid Robotics Applications
- The **OOS Philosophy** (introduced in [Introduction to ROS 2](./introduction-to-ros2-for-physical-ai.md)) applies to both communication architecture and robot structure design
- **Agent-Controller Pattern** (described in [ROS 2 Communication Model](./ros2-communication-model.md)) is particularly relevant when implementing control systems for humanoid robots described in URDF format
