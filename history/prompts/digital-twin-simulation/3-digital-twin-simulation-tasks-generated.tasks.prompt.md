# Digital Twin Simulation Tasks Generated

## Prompt
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response
Successfully generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the Digital Twin Simulation module. The tasks are organized across 6 phases:

1. Setup phase: Initialize Docusaurus documentation structure
2. Foundational components: Create shared infrastructure
3. User Story 1 (P1): Physics Simulation with Gazebo
4. User Story 2 (P2): Digital Twins & HRI using Unity
5. User Story 3 (P3): Sensor Simulation & Validation
6. Polish & cross-cutting concerns

The tasks document contains 58 specific tasks with proper formatting, user story labels, parallelization markers, and clear file paths. Each user story has independent test criteria and acceptance criteria aligned with the original specification.

## Outcome
Tasks are ready for implementation. Total of 58 tasks across three user stories with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities identified. The MVP scope includes completing User Story 1 (Physics Simulation with Gazebo).
