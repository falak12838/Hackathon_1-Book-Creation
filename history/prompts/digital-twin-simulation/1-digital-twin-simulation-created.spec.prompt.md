# Digital Twin Simulation Specification Created

## Prompt
```
Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Target audience:
- AI and robotics students building simulated humanoid environments

Focus:
- Physical-based simulation with Gazebo
- High-fidelity digital twins and HRI using Unity
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU)

Structure (Docusaurus):
- Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
- Chapter 2: Digital Twins & HRI using Unity
- Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation & Validation

- Tech: Docusaurus (all files in .md)
```

## Response
Successfully created a comprehensive specification for the Digital Twin Simulation module focusing on Gazebo and Unity. The specification includes:

- Three prioritized user stories covering Physics Simulation (P1), Digital Twins & HRI (P2), and Sensor Simulation (P3)
- Functional requirements for physics simulation, digital twin creation, HRI, and sensor simulation
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes for student learning
- Quality checklist to validate the specification

The specification addresses the needs of AI and robotics students learning to build simulated humanoid environments using Gazebo for physics simulation and Unity for high-fidelity digital twins and HRI.

## Outcome
Specification is ready for review and can proceed to the planning phase (/sp.plan). All [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers have been resolved by making reasonable assumptions based on industry standards.
