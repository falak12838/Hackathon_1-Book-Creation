## Prompt

Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Target audience:
- AI and robotics students building simulated humanoid environments

Focus:
- Physical-based simulation with Gazebo
- High-fidelity digital twins and HRI using Unity
- Sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU)

Structure (Docusaurus):
- Chapter 1: Physics Simulation with Gazebo
- Chapter 2: Digital Twins & HRI using Unity
- Chapter 3: Sensor Simulation & Validation

- Tech: Docusaurus (all files in .md)

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive specification for the Digital Twin module focusing on Gazebo and Unity integration for AI and robotics students. The specification includes:

- User stories for physics simulation (P1), digital twins/HRI (P2), and sensor simulation (P3)
- Functional requirements covering Gazebo physics, Unity visualization, and sensor simulation capabilities
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes for student experience and system performance
- Key entities definition for the digital twin system
- Quality checklist to validate the specification

The specification addresses physics-based simulation with Gazebo, high-fidelity digital twins using Unity, and sensor simulation (LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU) for humanoid environments.

## Outcome
