# PHR: Module 1 content creation

## PROMPT
plzzz create module 1 chapter content

## RESPONSE
Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) content was already created as part of previous implementation work. The three main chapters were found in a duplicate directory and have been moved to the correct location:

- Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI
- ROS 2 Communication Model
- Robot Structure with URDF

Each chapter includes comprehensive content with practical examples, exercises, and hands-on content as specified in the original requirements. The content was moved from "docs/module-1-ros2-nervous-system copy/" to "docs/robotic-nervous-system/" and the duplicate directory was removed.

## OUTCOME
All three chapters of Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) are now properly located in the docs/robotic-nervous-system/ directory and ready for use in the Docusaurus documentation site. The content includes educational material for AI students and developers entering humanoid robotics with basic Python and AI background.
