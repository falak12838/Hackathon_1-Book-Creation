# PHR: sp.specify command execution

## PROMPT
Module 1 - The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Target audience:
- AI students and developers entering humanoid robotics
- Learners with basic Python and AI background

Focus:
- ROS 2 as the middleware nervous system for humanoid robots
- Core communication concepts and humanoid description

Chapters(Docusaurus):
1. Introduction to ROS 2 for Physical AI
   - What ROS 2 is. why is matters for humanoids, OOS concepts
2. ROS 2 Communication Model
  - Nodes, Topics, Services, basic rclpy-based agent <-> controller flow
3. Robot Structure with URDF
   - Understanding URDF for humanoid robots and simulation readiness plzzz this module create on book

## RESPONSE
The specification for the "Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)" educational module already exists in the project at specs/1-robotic-nervous-system/spec.md. The existing specification includes:

- User Story 1: ROS 2 Introduction for Humanoids
- User Story 2: ROS 2 Communication Model Understanding
- User Story 3: Robot Structure with URDF
- Functional requirements covering educational content, practical examples, and simulation readiness
- Success criteria with measurable outcomes for each user story
- Key entities and assumptions/dependencies

The existing specification matches the requested feature requirements exactly.

## OUTCOME
Confirmed that the requested feature specification already exists and is complete. No new specification needed to be created.
